All orders are subject to processing time that is separate and apart from the time it takes for a shipment to reach its destination once it has been picked up from our fulfillment center by the applicable carrier. Depending on a number of factors, standard domestic and international orders may take up to 3-7 business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays) to process.<div id="ird7fa"><br id="istw2f"></div></div><div id="ib4dw7">Generally, shipping may take three (3) business days to forty (40) business days from receipt of your properly completed order (excluding applicable processing time). Shipping of International order(s) and those for other U.S. Territories may take longer. In all cases, shipping dates may be extended, such as, when there is a surge in delivery volume especially during peak seasons or when due to unforeseen factors outside of our control (e.g., local delivery partners delays, strikes, unusual weather, pandemic-related delays, etc.). Thus, while we try to ship out your order on time, due to unforeseen circumstances, it is possible that actual delivery by our local delivery partners may take longer than expected. When your order has been shipped, you will receive an email with tracking information. We will provide tracking numbers for all purchases upon shipment.</div><div id="ixubcf">SHIPPING DELAY NOTICE (FOR US RESIDENTS)</div><div id="iwdwso">If we are unable to ship out your order(s) within 40 days from receipt of your properly completed order (excluding applicable processing time), we will reach out to you via a Delay Notice to inform you of the unanticipated delay and a revised shipment date of up to 30 days (“Original Extended Period”).

Upon receipt of the Further Delay Notice, you may agree to the delay, by notifying us through email, phone call, or timely written notice. If we do not hear from you and we have not shipped by the Original Extended Period, your order is automatically cancelled.</div><div id="ixfqmj">REFUND (US RESIDENTS ONLY)</div><div id="i49mnm">In all cases of cancellation due to delay in shipping as stated above, you will receive a refund.</div><div id="i5rdh2">DELIVERY</div><div id="ilyvn9">Excluding products which are pre-ordered, the estimated delivery time is sixty (60) business days and delivery delays can occasionally occur. Products which are pre-ordered will clearly display the estimated delivery date on the checkout form and order confirmation page.</div><div id="iafb19">Pre-ordered products will be delivered to you on or around the estimated date specified in the Checkout page. Although we will make efforts to begin shipping products as soon as reasonably practicable, you understand and agree that there may be delays. An estimated time of shipment or delivery is only an estimate and is subject to change. Delivery time is only a general estimate from our local delivery partners, over which we have no control and can be delayed by unforeseen circumstances. We do not represent or warrant that we will be able to ship or our local delivery partner will be able to deliver the product by the estimated date. As a result, in the event that a delay arises and the estimated shipment or delivery date is not met, we are not responsible for any damages that may occur due to the delay, nor shall we be obligated, except as set forth in these Terms or except as provided by law, to provide any discounts, refunds or credits due to any such delays.
